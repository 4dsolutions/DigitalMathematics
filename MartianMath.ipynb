    "# Synergetics\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Synergetics\" is the name Fuller eventually gave to his life-long philosophical explorations, which were distilled into a two-volume magnum opus, *Synergetics* and *Synergetics 2*, published by Macmillan in 1975 and 1979 respectively, with softcover editions, and a posthumous web-based edition to follow.  The process of distilling and publishing the two volumes was undertaken in collaboration with [E.J. Applewhite](http://www.grunch.net/synergetics/applewhites.html), who wrote *Cosmic Fishing* to chronicle their adventure.  Dr. Arthur Loeb, crystallographer and Renaissance man in his own right, wrote the Preface.\n",

    "\n",
    "At the core of Synergetics is Fuller's critique of ancient Greek metaphysics and its right-angled orthodoxies. He emphasizes the topological and structural advantages of the tetrahedron (simpler, stronger) over the cube, and devises a system of geometric relationships in the form of nested polyhedra dubbed \"the concentric hierarchy\" with the tetrahedron as his unit of volume.  His vocabulary is deliberately remote (250.30) as he seeks to relate tension, syntropy and gravity to their complements: compression, entropy and radiation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fuller regarded his \"explorations in the geometry of thinking\" (the book's subtitle) as the principle source of his inventions and a direct result of his commitment, undertaken in 1927, to serve humanity as a whole, a goal which necessitated a deep rethinking of our shared predicament and prospects aboard Spaceship Earth.  In retrospect, we see Fuller was in tune with the zeitgeist in terms of the topics he focused on:  sphere packing, vectorial energy models, topology, tensegrity, geodesic spheres and domes.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Categorization of the work, in terms of genre, has proved elusive. Dr. Peter Suber of Earlham College eventually accepted it as a philosophy, based on Fuller's own conception of what it was: \n",
    "\n",

    "Some critices keep insisting Synergetics is strictly empirical, which tends to mean statistical and data driven. True, Fuller favored the term *experiential* which included the intuitive (e.g. flashes of insight, gestalt shifts). Synergetics is open to the special case, but does not reduce to reductionism.  The anti-reductionist tone of Synergetics is what some scientists object to, but in this respect they're not speaking for all of Science, nor is *Synergetics* the only anti-reductionist philosophy out there.\n",

    "> There are no solids. There are no things. There are only interfering and noninterfering patterns operative in pure principle, and principles are eternal. Principles never contradict principles. . . . The synergetic integral of the totality of principles is God, whose sum-total behavior in pure principle is beyond our comprehension and is utterly mysterious to us, because as humans — in pure principle — we do not and never will know all the principles.

    "Two teachers may have the same pile of Art & Science in front of them, to communicate to a next generation, but one of them is Bucky, and he gets his students to consider sphere packing and polyhedrons early, when they're still very young.  The other teacher shares the average more mediocre stuff we sometimes mistake for the real deal aka the \"right stuff\" and pushes polyhedrons off to the side somewhere, making sure they can't matter.\n",
    "\n",
    "I would echo a natural science professors in saying \"don't *just* read Synergetics\" but I would not say \"don't read *Synergetics*\" i.e. I think Synergetics, a philosophy, a work in the humanities, continues to yield good ideas for STEM, worth exploring further and perhaps using architecturally, computationally, or in some other way.  \n",
    "\n",
    "I don't think *Synergetics* + *Synergetics 2* should be treated as the one and only book one needs to read, as maybe too many treat their Bibles or whatever else they consider \"holy\".  Even if we admit Synergetics into the canon as a \"sacred geometry\" text, we are thereby only adding it to a still-growing library that already contains many lifetimes worth of reading and thinking.\n",

    "Fuller felt he'd discovered a font, a fountain, a source, a cosmic zero, and wanted to pass it on to coming generations.  He considered it critical that more of us mine in the same vein.  He delivered his message with a sense of urgency.\n",
