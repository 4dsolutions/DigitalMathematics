    "# Synergetics\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Synergetics\" is the name Fuller eventually gave to his life-long philosophical explorations, which were distilled into a two-volume magnum opus, *Synergetics* and *Synergetics 2*, published by Macmillan in 1975 and 1979 respectively, with softcover editions, and a posthumous web-based edition to follow.  The process of distilling and publishing the two volumes was undertaken in collaboration with [E.J. Applewhite](http://www.grunch.net/synergetics/applewhites.html), who wrote *Cosmic Fishing* to chronicle their adventure.  Dr. Arthur Loeb, crystallographer and Renaissance Man in his own right, wrote the Preface.\n",

    "\n",
    "At the core of Synergetics is Fuller's critique of ancient Greek metaphysics and its right-angled orthodoxies. He emphasizes the topological and structural advantages of the tetrahedron (simpler, stronger) over the cube, and devises a system of geometric relationships in the form of nested polyhedra dubbed \"the concentric hierarchy\" with the tetrahedron as his unit of volume.  His vocabulary is deliberately remote (250.30) as he seeks to relate tension, syntropy and gravity to their complements: compression, entropy and radiation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fuller regarded his \"explorations in the geometry of thinking\" (the book's subtitle) as the principle source of his inventions and a direct result of his commitment, undertaken in 1927, to serve humanity as a whole, a goal which necessitated a deep rethinking of our shared predicament and prospects aboard Spaceship Earth.  In retrospect, we see Fuller was in tune with the zeitgeist in terms of the topics he focused on:  sphere packing, space filling, vectorial energy models, topology, tensegrity, geodesic spheres and domes.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Categorization of the work, in terms of genre, has proved elusive. Dr. Peter Suber of Earlham College eventually accepted it as a philosophy, based on Fuller's own conception of what it was: \n",
    "\n",
    "> The integration of geometry and philosophy in a single conceptual system providing a common language and accounting for both the physical and metaphysical. (251.50)"

    "Synergetics is a geometric language pumped full of as much significance as possible. Getting all experiences to mean something in terms of geometry might seem undoable at first, but the tack is to get a view of thinking itself, to present the thinking process in terms of a geometric model. \n",
    "\n",
    "By thinking about thinking in terms of geometry, all thought content is thereby brought within its scope.\n",
    "\n",
    "The synergetics model of thinking is derived by analogy to the electromagnetic spectrum. It helps that we already have a vernacular wherein like-minded people are \"on the same wavelength\" and wherein ideas get \"tuned in\". In synergetics, the brain is the metaphorical \"TV transceiver\" wherein sense-relayed programs are presented to experience.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Thinking is FM -- frequency modulation -- for it results in tuning-out of irrelevancies as a result of definitive resolution of the exclusively tuned-in or accepted feed-back messages' pattern differentiability.  WDSD 1965-1975\n",
    "\n",
    "The electromagnetic spectrum as traditionally depicted in textbooks is a linear affair, from shortest to longest wavelengths. Synergetics depicts this continuum of shortest to longest as concentric spherical networks. \n",
    "\n",
    "The highest frequency systems are towards the center, whereas larger scale phenomena (e.g. the tiny slice of the spectrum visible to the naked eye) occupy middle to outer layers of the spectral onion.\n",
    "\n",
    "To think, then, is to highlight one spherical band within the continuum, to select a channel. Higher and lower bands are \"dismissed as irrelevant\" and/or included as \"twilight zone possibly relevant\" because, relative to the tuned-in system, these higher and lower frequency bands come across as mere noise and/or as tantalizingly full of clues.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Universe (as all-experience) is inherently omni-directional in its observational orientations -- ergo, the temporary putting-aside of the two classes of irrelevancies requires an omnidirectional putting aside which differentiates as an outwardly dismissed macro cosmic disposition of the too-large and too-infrequent conceptual informations and an inwardly dismissed residue set of all the too-miniscule and too-frequent events -- ergo, the lucidly tuned in, residually considerable set of event-foci. WDSD 1965-1975\n",
    "\n",
    "Too high a frequency might mean: too detailed, too trivial, too nitpicky, or literally too small to be sensed. Too low might mean: too general, too cosmic, or too spread apart in time and/or space to be noticably a part of the pattern currently under consideration (in focus). \n",
    "\n",
    "Amidst all the transceiver brain traffic, some thoughts are too fleeting, escaping before becoming incorporated, classified or organized within a larger system. Other thoughts are too long in dawning, by which time the train of thought to which they might have attached has long ago vanished over the horizon.\n",

I thought sympathetically of nature's having to make all those myriad frustrated decisions each time she made a bubble. I didn't see how she managed to formulate the wake of every ship while managing the rest of the universe if she had to make all those decisions. So I said to myself, \"I don't think nature uses œÄ.

    "### An Assessment \n",
    "##### By Kirby Urner\n",
    "\n",
    "Calling *Synergetics* a Neoplatonic Metaphysics is not off the mark, but STEM is not Science only, and includes Mathematics, closer to Platonism than any empiricism.  \n",
    "\n",
    "There's a role for the *a priori*.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Some apologists keep insisting Synergetics is strictly empirical, which in this day and age tends to mean statistical and data driven, as well as experimental. Fuller favored the term *experiential* which includes the intuitive (e.g. flashes of insight, gestalt shifts). \n",
    "\n",
    "Synergetics accommodates the temporal special case, but does not reduce to a reductionism.  This anti-reductionist aspect of Synergetics is what some scientists object to, but in this respect they're not speaking for all of Science (e.g. \"teleological pressure\" may seem self evident to some lab workers), nor is *Synergetics* the only anti-reductionist philosophy out there; that these rifts and debates continue is predictable, based on their cultural inertia (momentum).\n",
    "\n",
    "> There are no solids. There are no things. There are only interfering and non-interfering patterns operative in pure principle, and principles are eternal. Principles never contradict principles. . . . The synergetic integral of the totality of principles is God, whose sum-total behavior in pure principle is beyond our comprehension and is utterly mysterious to us, because as humans ‚Äî in pure principle ‚Äî we do not and never will know all the principles. [Wikiquote](https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Buckminster_Fuller#Critical_Path_(1981))\n",
    "\n",
    "How we summarize and present material, how we optimize, hybridize and alloy the topics together, makes a difference. How well is one able to visualize?  Or empathize, at some global gut level?  What curricula offer training in that?\n",
    "\n",
    "Two teachers may have the same pile of Art & Science in front of them, to communicate to a next generation, but one of them is Bucky, and he gets students to consider sphere packing and polyhedrons early, when they're still young.  The other teacher shares the average, more mediocre stuff we sometimes mistake for the real deal and pushes polyhedrons off to the side somewhere, making sure they can't matter.  What will be the outcome?  \n",
    "\n",
    "The question is rhetorical as the experiment is not adequately specified, but my point is Synergetics has the potential to encourage a disciplined imagination much as logic does conventionally.\n",
    "\n",
    "I would echo a natural science professor in saying \"don't *just* read Synergetics\" but I would not say \"do not read *Synergetics*\" (implying it's a waste of time) i.e. I think Synergetics, a philosophy, a work in the humanities, continues to yield positive ideas worth exploring further and perhaps using architecturally, computationally, pedagogically, andragogically, or in some other way in service of this game we call \"the world\".  \n",
    "\n",
    "I don't think *Synergetics* + *Synergetics 2* should be treated as supremely authoritative, nor as the one and only subject one need study, as maybe too many treat their Bibles or whatever else they consider \"holy\" and/or \"infallible\".  \n",
    "\n",
    "Fuller felt he'd discovered a font, a fountain, a source, a cornucopia, a cosmic zero, and wanted to pass it on to coming generations.  He considered it critical that more of us mine in the same vein, invest in the same vortex.  He delivered his message with a sense of urgency, leaving bread crumbs (clues) everywhere he went.  Who would receive his communications?  That's always an open question.  The goal, from Fuller's viewpoint, was to maximize the chances others would.\n",
    "\n",
    "Per one of Fuller's last interviews, [with Patricia Ravasio](https://www.bookpassage.com/event/patricia-ravasio-girl-spaceship-earth-san-francisco), he had a premonition that his work would be sidelined and relegated to obscurity by the powers that be.  His \"world that works for everyone\" philosophy was at odds with the ideology of those planning to finally \"win the cold war\" against the Russians. \n",
    "\n",
    "I think Fuller was correct in his assessment -- hence my marketing his math-teaching innovations as \"verboten math\", and later \"Martian Math\" because still so alien -- which came amidst the demise of the USA as a democracy as recounted in his satirical *Grunch of Giants* (1983, St. Martin's Press), its publication coinciding with his receiving a Medal of Freedom from then president Reagan.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Quite clearly, our task is predominantly metaphysical, for it is how to get all of humanity to educate itself swiftly enough to generate spontaneous social behaviors that will avoid extinction. [Wikiquote](https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Buckminster_Fuller#The_Wellspring_of_Reality)\n",
    "\n",
    "> Of course, our failures are a consequence of many factors, but possibly one of the most important is the fact that society operates on the theory that specialization is the key to success, not realizing that specialization precludes comprehensive thinking. *Operating Manual for Spaceship Earth* (1969)\n",
    "\n",
    "In retrospect, megatrends suggest he's attracting people who call themselves Designers more than he's attracting Scientists, but then we have the term \"Design Science\" to keep these two glued together, as well as [Designing Engineers](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/designing-engineers).\n",
    "\n",
    "What continues to challenge Designers is language itself, and Synergetics is an experiment in language design, using old words in new ways, as well as introducing some new ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "I will conclude with a quote from John McHale, in the foreword to *Comprehensive Thinking* by R. Buckminster Fuller, World Design Science Decade 1965 - 1975, Phase One (1965), Document 3, World Resources Inventory, Southern Illinois University:\n",
    "\n",
    "> Though the language of some of the texts may seem difficult at first approach, it should be borne in mind that one of our major problems in thinking today is the use of language systems which still represent a fixed structurally compartmentalized world view. The terms available to us for the expression of dynamic, rather than static, concepts are far from satisfactory. Fuller's language is particularly representative of the 'transitional state (of the Western world) between the older, traditional, noun-centered culture and its present day, changing, verb-centered culture'. In his search for an adequately descriptive terminology he tends to employ concepts and usages from many different fields juxtaposed in ways which may be unfamiliar to those more customarily restrained within the vocabularies of particular disciplines."
